# -Gene-expression-survival-analysis-R
This project, developed using R, was carried out as part of a fourth-year university course in Data Analysis in Medicine. 

The gene expression analysis on AML subtypes to identify molecular differences. Processed and cleaned transcriptomic data from TCGA, building design and contrast matrices for robust statistical analysis. Applied linear modeling using the limma package, identifying differentially expressed genes associated with each AML subtype. Performed functional enrichment analyses, including ORA and GSEA. 

The survival analysis in lung carcinoma patients identifies relevant clinical and demographic variables that may influence prognosis. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests to compare group survival. Performed simple and multiple logistic regressions to evaluate independent and combined effects on mortality. Applied a multivariable Cox regression model to assess the impact of clinical and demographic factors on survival.
